# Exercise 3
# Obtain a table containing the following three fields for all individuals whose employee number is no greater than 10040:
# - employee number
# - the smallest department number among the departments where an employee has worked in (use a subquery to retrieve this value from the 'dept_emp' table)
# - assign '110022' as 'manager' to all individuals whose employee number is less than or equal to 10020, and '110039' to those whose number is between 10021 and 10040 inclusive (use a CASE statement to create the third field).
SELECT 
	e.emp_no,
	(	SELECT 
			MIN(dept_no)
		FROM 
			t_dept_emp de 
		WHERE 
			e.emp_no = de.emp_no
	) dept_no,
	CASE 
		WHEN emp_no <= 10020 THEN '110022'
		ELSE '110039'
	END AS manager
FROM t_employees e
WHERE emp_no <= 10040;
